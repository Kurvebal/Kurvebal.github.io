					<h2> About Splinter </h2>
					<p> Splinter was rescued by Furever Homes in Olympia, Wa from a high-kill shelter in California. Not much is known about his story other than that his previous name was "Trooper." He was adopted by Josh in September 2015. Despite being extremely skiddish, throwing up in the car on the way home, and refusing to leave his crate for about 15 hours, splinter eventually warmed up to the delightful pup he is today. Slowly but surely it was revealed that his skiddish was in fact a discerning zen wisdom that no one could have previously foreseen..</p>
